Evaluation for web version of created website
----------------------------------------------
For achieving web version of test, I have been used the elements that exported from the Figma. Furthermore, technical parts which have been used for this test include HTML, CSS, JavaScript(JQuery), and Bootstrap 3 framework. Each part of the web page is also marked with comments in both HMTL and CSS files for easy understanding which part I have been reached. Other resourses that required for this web version are also included in index file as CDN links or downloaded files such as font-awesome icons, and Ubuntu fonts. 

Evaluation for mobile version of created website
-------------------------------------------------
For achieving mobile version of this website, Bootstrap 3 and media query of CSS have been used. In displaying the sections of web without losing the aspect ration, Bootstrap elements such as (row, col-lg-* and col-xs-* ) for changing different stylings at larger and smaller screen sizes. Media query is also implemented for adjusting the positions of different elements, hiding elements, and displaying new items. 

Further Improvement
-------------------
1. About responsive design for tablet
Although the current created website is enabled in mobile which it's width is less than 375px and desktop which it's width is larger than 1200px, but it's not suitable for tablet size. When browsing device is tablet, elements in this website will become scatter to wrong positions. Therefore, putting responsive features for tablet will enhance the user experience.
2. About other techniques
In this test, preprocessors for CSS such as sass, stylus, and less haven't used. Actually, using anyone of these not only can rocket the speed of development, but also create effective code in reducing unnecessaries. It also can help in reducing code volume and enhancing the code consistency. 
3. About browser compatibility
Current website is only tested with Mozilla Firefox (version 67), Chrome (version 74) for both web and mobile versions. It's not tested in other browsers which include Safari and Opera.
